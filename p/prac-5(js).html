    <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 
        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
         It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O),
         such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.</p>
