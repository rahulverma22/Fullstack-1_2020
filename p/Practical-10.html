            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language,and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.
        Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages(HTML documents) are linked together.
        Thus, the link available on a webpage is called on a webpage is called Hypertext.
        As its name suggests,HTML is a markup language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text 
        document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display Originally.
        HTML was dveloped with the intent of defining the sturcture of document like hedings,
        paragraph,list,and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between resaerches.
        CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets, and is the preferred way for setting the look and feel of a website. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a markup language responsible for how your web pages will look like. It controls the colors, fonts, and layouts of your website elements.
        This style sheet language also allows you to add effects or animations to your website. You can use it to display some CSS animations like click button effects, spinners or loaders, and animated backgrounds. Without CSS, your website will appear as a plain HTML page.The cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. For example, setting the colour of body text will mean all headings and paragraphs within the body will also be the same colour.
